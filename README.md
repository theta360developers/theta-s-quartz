# CamTwist Effect Plugin to Convert Theta-S Live Video from Fisheye to Equirectangular via Quartz
An experiment to use OS X Quartz Composer to transform Ricoh Theta S live feed dual fisheye to equirectangular.

NOTE JUN 2016: Ricoh has since released native OS drivers to accomplish this: https://theta360.com/en/support/download/

Goal is to create a Quartz composition that can be used in camtwist or other live video streaming software to adjust live the output of the theta-s to be suitable for using in a 360' web panorama plugin. The flow will be something like this:
* Theta S via USB or HDMI > Computer
* Computer to use this Quartz composition from within Camtwist > Media encoder > HLS (via cloud encoding service) > web front-end
* Web front-end needs equirectangular image, see this example: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/

## Current state - Proof of concept works
* theta-fish2sphere.qtz - this "routes" camtwist through Paul Bourke's custom quartz patch project (see references below)

* @kosso modified version added : theta-fish2sphere_K.qtz with reference images to play with.


### Reference Input Image

##### Test Output Snapshot

!['Example Output Image .. so far'](https://github.com/kosso/theta-s-quartz/blob/master/OUTPUT.png?raw=true =600x)


### Example images:
* Sample input file (raw dual fisheye from theta-s): https://github.com/kfarr/theta-s-quartz/blob/master/theta-s-raw-Frame-01-03-2016-02-00-34.jpg
* Example of desired output (this is post-processed by theta-s software, but not available for live streaming): https://github.com/kfarr/theta-s-quartz/blob/master/desired-output-R0010093.jpg

## To use:
* Download camtwist http://camtwiststudio.com/, install to applications
* Add theta-fish2sphere.qtz and theta-crop.qtz to Applications > CamTwist > Effects
* Open CamTwist
* Step 1: View > Main Window, Double click "Webcam" and choose RICOH THETA S
* Step 2: Choose filter theta-fish2sphere
* Step 3: Modify settings if you'd like, not sure it'll make much of a difference yet. Make sure to press enter after you enter new values.

## How to modify:
* Download quartz composer from Apple's developer site http://developer.apple.com/downloads by searching for "Graphics Tools for Xcode"
* Open theta-fish2sphere.qtz file in quartz composer
* Change input image source to theta s on USB or HDMI input live stream, or use sample image from this git project's root dir

## Dev notes for Quartz Composer
* For testing / developing in QC, you'll need to unhook the "Image (Required)" patch and use instead the image patch "image-example of 720p theta-s stream"
* Ideally in QC during dev one could use video input patch to use as reference for modifying settings, but it is not consistent with behavior when ran inside of camtwist
